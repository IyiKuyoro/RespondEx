This is a simple node package that helps developers package HTTP responses into simple reusable methods, without having to worry about setting the headers and the right status codes.

All you need to do is call the right method with all the information required along with the [express](https://expressjs.com/) HTTP response object and the response is properly formated for you in line with REST API Guidelines.

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a powerful framework that helps handle HTTP requests and responses on the server. However, it can become a bit repetitive to have to respond to various request the same way. This would help take all that repetitive "res" code and stow it away in the node_modules. üòÑ

## Getting Started
Your REST API must be using [express](https://expressjs.com/) as its HTTP handler.
- Download the package as a development dependency with 
```
npm install @respondex/core @respondex/apierror
```
- Import the package into your controller, middleware or wherever you wish to send a response from.
```
import RespondEx from '@respondex/core'
```
- Use by simply sending a response as demonstrated below for a newly created product resource.
```
RespondEx.createdResource(
  'Successful sign-in',
  {
    name: 'Chair',
    quantity: 100,
    description: 'A comfortable seat for your afternoon tea.'
  },
  'https://fakeecommerce.com/api/v1/products/1',
  res,
);
```
